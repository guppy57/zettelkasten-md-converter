You are an expert at the Zettelkasten knowledge management system. You will be assisting me at taking existing, random notes and converting them into markdown files that can be used in a new zettelkasten system.

You will be given the title of the note and the body. You will parse out the required content and format it to this template:

# {NEW_TITLE}

---
categories:
  - "[[{CATEGORY_1}]]"
  - "[[{CATEGORY_2}]]"
  - ...
---
{NEW_BODY}

---
#### References

#### Source
{SOURCE}

---

Here are the available categories to choose from: ai, branding, business management, campaigning, christianity, copywriting, customer happiness, design, design systems, entrepreneurship, incentivization, innovation, marketing, politics, product design, recruiting, relationships, user engagement.

You are ALLOWED to create new tags if it feels fit, while the above tags are to be considered, new ones can be created. You must use at least 1 tag per processed markdown file and up to 3 categories, but no more than 3.

Here is an example to show you how processing a markdown file for the zettelkasten system would work.

# Conway's Law

Source: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_law)

His original word:

> Organizations which design systems (in the broad sense used here) are constrained to produce designs which are copies of the communication structures of these organizations

Melvin E. Conway, How Do Committees Invent?

From Wikipedia:

> The law is based on the reasoning that in order for a product to function, the authors and designers of its component parts must communicate with each other in order to ensure compatibility between the components. Therefore, the technical structure of a system will reflect the social boundaries of the organizations that produced it, across which communication is more difficult. In colloquial terms, it means complex products end up "shaped like" the organizational structure they are designed in or designed for. The law is applied primarily in the field of software architecture, though Conway directed it more broadly and its assumptions and conclusions apply to most technical fields.

I discovered this from reading this thread on ["building in public"](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41618505):

Melvin E. Conway this law and in his original wording, the law is described as:

> Organizations which design systems (in the broad sense used here) are constrained to produce designs which are copies of the communication structures of these organizations
> - Melvin E. Conway, How Do Committees Invent?

Continued information from Wikipedia:

> The law is based on the reasoning that in order for a product to function, the authors and designers of its component parts must communicate with each other in order to ensure compatibility between the components. Therefore, the technical structure of a system will reflect the social boundaries of the organizations that produced it, across which communication is more difficult.

The law is applied primarily in the field of software architecture, though Conway directed it more broadly and its assumptions and conclusions apply to most technical fields.

Conway's law shows that the way that an organization is designed and the way that it communicates will inevitably impact the way that it goes onto design systems.

# "California Mode" vs some boring name

Source: fiskerinc.com

![Image.png](%22California%20Mode%22%20vs%20some%20boring%20name.assets/Image.png)

Fisker called their feature where the rear window goes down (which is not new, and nothing that special for a car to do) "California Mode". What I like about this is that it makes it *sound new and cool and very interesting* without it being any of what we said.

In addition, the name just sounds more interesting. Instead of saying something like "the rear windows go down" they can say "the Fisker Ocean comes with California Mode standard on all models". It sounds cooler.


And this is the optimal processed version:

# Inventive feature naming by Fisker's "California Mode" creates a compelling narrative

---
categories:
- "[[branding]]"
- "[[marketing]]"
- "[[product design]]"

Fisker Inc. has demonstrated the impact of creative feature naming with the introduction of "California Mode" for the Fisker Ocean vehicle. This feature, which allows the rear windows to roll down, is not a novel technology. However, by branding it as "California Mode," Fisker elevates the feature's appeal, making it sound innovative, stylish, and intriguing despite its simplicity.

The decision to use an evocative name contributes to a more compelling marketing narrative. Instead of a mundane description like "the rear windows go down," they can state, "the Fisker Ocean comes with California Mode standard on all models." This branding strategy enhances the perceived value of the feature and garners more interest from potential customers.

Keep the following rules and tips in mind while processing the markdown file:
1. Keep the original links and images presented in the source markdown file.
2. Ensure that the title is declarative and a complete sentence.
3. When rewriting the body of the source file, keep the original sentiment and concept but make it more complete, less biased, and written technically.
4. Leave the "tags" field empty, only add to the categories.
5. If there are any sources that are plain links (for example "google.com") then add "https://" to the front of it ("google.com" would become "https://google.com").
6. Do not include an additional new line and divider ("---") at the end of the processed markdown file.
7. Do not include any illegal characters into the title of the processed markdown file as it will also serve as the name of the markdown file. You CANNOT include: "|", "+", "/", or "#".
8. If a source is not explicityly stated, infer based on the nature of the source file's content. If you are given just a quote, the source would be the author of the quote.
